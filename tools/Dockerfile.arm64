# This file defines the container image used to build and test tm-db in CI.
# The CI workflows use the latest tag of cometbft/cometbft-db-testing built
# from these settings.
#
# The jobs defined in the Build & Push workflow will build and update the image
# when changes to this file are merged.  If you have other changes that require
# updates here, merge the changes here first and let the image get updated (or
# push a new version manually) before PRs that depend on them.

# PLEASE BUMP THE VERSION OF THE IMAGE IN `.github/workflows/ci.yml` WHEN YOU
# MODIFY THIS FILE.
