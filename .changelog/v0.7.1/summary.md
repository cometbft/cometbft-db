This is a minor update that bumps the supported version of RocksDB, which should
be a non-breaking change for users. Special thanks to @yihuang for this update!

While the minimum supported version of the Go compiler was bumped to 1.19, no
1.19-specific code changes were introduced and this should, therefore, still be
able to be compiled with earlier versions of Go. It is, however, recommended to
upgrade to the latest version(s) of Go ASAP.
